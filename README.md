This repository contains my portfolio of investment and finance-related data science projects. These projects are written and presented as Jupyter Notebooks (Python 3), and each link is followed by a short description of project goals, contributions, and dependencies used.
All of the following projects were coded and tested through the Domino Data Lab platform (https://www.dominodatalab.com). I chose to use Domino because the platform allows for easy access to Jupyter notebooks, a built-in terminal, and offline scheduling of jobs for periodic regulation of stock prices.
